The source data are from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. 
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
The data for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

##R script

File with R code "run_analysis.R" performs the 5 following steps :
1.Reading in the files and merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3.Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names
5.Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

##Variables
x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the downloaded files.
x_data, y_data and subject_data merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
